# Navbar

**Navbar** is a Streamlit-based explorer for `.h5ad` single-cell datasets for our IGVF projects, designed for interactive visualization and QC of our lab data. It is under active development and is most responsive with datasets of 20,000 cells or fewer, but can handle datasets up to ~100,000 cells. It is hopefully useful to others, especially if you use some of the same adata obs fields that we use.

---

## Features

- **Splash Dataset Selector:** Choose from a list of datasets (local files or URLs) via a CSV config file before loading.
- **Flexible Data Loading:** Load `.h5ad` files from local paths, remote URLs, or by uploading directly in the sidebar.
- **Tabbed Interface:**  
  - **Summary Info:** Overview of dataset, metadata, and available slots.
  - **QC:** Plate heatmaps, knee plots, and violin plots for QC metrics.
  - **Embedding Plot:** Visualize UMAP, t-SNE, or PCA embeddings colored by metadata.
  - **Gene Expression:** Plot gene expression on embeddings and as plate heatmaps.
  - **Marker Genes:** Calculate and view marker genes for clusters or groups.
  - **Pathway Analysis:** GSEA and other enrichment analyses.
  - **Pseudobulk PCA/DEG:** Pseudobulk PCA and differential expression.
- **Progress Bar:** Visual feedback when downloading large remote files.
- **Downloadable Plots:** Export figures as PNG or SVG.
- **Session State:** Remembers your selections and allows switching datasets without restarting the app.

## Usage

### **Basic Usage**

To launch Navbar with a single `.h5ad` file:
```sh
python code/navbar/navbar.py -- --h5ad /path/to/your_data.h5ad
```
Or with a remote file:
```sh
python code/navbar/navbar.py -- --h5ad https://yourserver.org/data/mydata.h5ad
```

### **Using a CSV Config File**

You can provide a CSV file listing multiple datasets (local or remote) for splash selection.  
Each line should be:  
`dataID,dataPath`  
where `dataPath` is a local file path or a URL.

**Example `IGVF.csv`:**

```

**To launch with a config file:**
```sh
python code/navbar/navbar.py -- --config code/navbar/IGVF.csv
```

You will be presented with a splash page to select which dataset to load.

---

### **Other Options**

- **Upload a file:** Use the sidebar in the app to upload a `.h5ad` file directly.
- **Enter a URL:** Paste a remote `.h5ad` URL in the sidebar to load it.
- **Enter a file path:** Type a local file path in the sidebar.

## Notes

- For best performance, use datasets with â‰¤20,000 cells for interactive exploration.
- Some features (e.g., GSEA, pseudobulk DEG) require additional dependencies.
- The app displays its version number in the sidebar.

## Example Command Lines

```sh
# Launch with a single local file
python code/navbar/navbar.py -- --h5ad /local/path/IGVF/Heart_integrated_processed_annotated_fixed_subsampled20k.h5ad

# Launch with a remote file
python code/navbar/navbar.py -- --h5ad https://api.data.igvf.org/matrix-files/IGVFFI3320ZCCE/@@download/IGVFFI3320ZCCE.h5ad

# Launch with a config CSV for splash selection
python code/navbar/navbar.py -- --config IGVF.csv
```
